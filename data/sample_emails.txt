Hi Team,

Great work on the deployment yesterday. However, we have a few lingering issues that need immediate attention before the Monday release.

1. The login page alignment is broken on mobile devices.
2. The API rate limiter is kicking in too early for premium users.
3. We need the updated API documentation by Friday EOD.

Please let me know who is picking up which task. Also, don't forget to update the Jira board.

Best,
Sarah

Subject: Inquiry regarding Enterprise Plan pricing

Hello,

I was looking at your pricing page and noticed you offer an Enterprise tier, but there is no specific pricing listed. 

Our company has about 500 seats and we would need SSO (Single Sign-On) integration. Could you send me a quote or set up a time to chat about the specific features included in this tier?

I am available this Thursday afternoon.

Regards,
Mark Anderson
CTO, Innovate IO

Hey!

It's been a while since we last spoke. I saw your update on LinkedIn about the new AI agent project—sounds fascinating!

I'm going to be in the city next Tuesday. If you have 30 mins, I'd love to grab a coffee and hear more about what you're building.

Let me know if you're around.

Cheers,
Dave
