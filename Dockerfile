# 1. Use an official lightweight Python image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the requirements file first (for better caching)
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install dependencies
# We use --no-cache-dir to keep the image small
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5. Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# 7. Define the command to run the application
# We use host 0.0.0.0 to allow external access
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.api.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
